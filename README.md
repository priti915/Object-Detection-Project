📌 Project Title:
Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv8 and OpenCV

📝 Description:
This project implements a real-time object detection system using a webcam feed. It leverages the powerful YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model from Ultralytics to detect and identify multiple common objects like faces, bottles, mobile phones, and more. The OpenCV library handles live video capture and visualizes the detection results with bounding boxes and labels on each frame.

🔍 Features:
- Real-time object detection via webcam
- Uses YOLOv8n (Nano) for fast, lightweight inference
- Detects 80+ object classes from the COCO dataset
- Displays live annotated video feed with detected objects

🧠 Tech Stack:
- Python
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLOv8 (yolov8n.pt)
